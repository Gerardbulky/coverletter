##### Dear Hiring Manager:
My name is Gerard, and I am living and working in Sweden. I am a driven Software Developer with proficiency in DevOps and modern Python for backend development.

Additionally, I have proven experience with JavaScript, React, Typescript and jQuery on the frontend. I also possess a strong interest in cloud technologies, including AWS and GCP, as well as experience in databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and SQL. I am well-versed in Python frameworks such as Django, Flask, and FastAPI, and I have experience with Jenkins, and GitHub Action for continuous integration and deployment. I have also successfully integrated payment systems with Stripe and have experience with containerization using Docker.

Motivated by my passion for technology, I continually sought to expand my knowledge and skills by enrolling on several online programming courses such as Udemy but decided to get a formal education in programming by attending the Code Institute Bootcamp in Dublin. Over the years, I have acquired valuable knowledge and expertise in my career.
My resume will provide a more detailed look into my professional and educational background. I appreciate your time and consideration.

Best Regards,

Gerard Ambe.
